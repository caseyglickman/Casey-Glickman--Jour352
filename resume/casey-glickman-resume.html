        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <h4>Resturant Server</h4>
        <h5>Fornino Brooklyn Bridge Park</h5>
        <h6>June 2024 - August 2024</h6>
        <p>I was responsible for delivering high-quality food and beverage service in a busy restaurant environment. This included preparing and serving beverages, as well as efficiently managing food service from start to finish. I maintained an in-depth knowledge of the menu, allowing me to answer customer questions, make recommendations, and accommodate special dietary needs or preferences. By fostering strong relationships with fellow servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff, I helped ensure smooth communication and a positive experience for all guests. Additionally, I was entrusted with key responsibilities such as opening and closing the restaurant, setting up and organizing the dining area, and ensuring everything was ready for service.</p>

        <h4>Hostess</h4>
        <h5>Iris Cafe</h5>
        <h6>August 2023</h6>
        <p>As a hostess, I was the first point of contact for guests, responsible for welcoming and seating them promptly to ensure a seamless dining experience. I maintained a warm and positive demeanor, helping to create a friendly and inviting atmosphere that encouraged repeat business. Additionally, I managed reservations, communicated wait times effectively, and coordinated seating arrangements to optimize the flow of the dining room.</p>

        <p>In my busser role, I ensured that all tables were properly set and presentable before each service. I was responsible for delivering food and drinks to tables, clearing dishes, resetting tables efficiently, and assisting the serving staff during peak hours. My attention to detail and teamwork contributed to a smooth and enjoyable dining experience for both guests and staff.</p>

        <h4>Investigative Journalist Student Intern</h4>
        <h5>City Limits NYC</h5>
        <h6>July 2021</h6>
        <p>Selected through a competitive application process, I participated in a month-long paid investigative journalism internship at City Limits. During the program, I developed foundational skills in investigative reporting and article writing. I conducted in-depth research, interviewed key sources, and collaborated with a team of journalists. A major focus of my work was co-writing an article on sexual assault and the criminal justice system, which was thoroughly researched and later published by City Limits. This experience strengthened my abilities in fact-checking, source-building, and producing impactful stories on sensitive topics.</p>

        <h4>Volunteer Tutor</h4>
        <h5>Learning Pals</h5>
        <h6>November 2020 - May 2027</h6>
        <p>As an academic tutor for elementary school students from low-income families, I developed personalized lesson plans tailored to each student's learning needs and academic goals. I provided one-on-one homework assistance, reinforced classroom concepts, and created engaging educational games to make learning enjoyable and effective. I also worked closely with students and their families, often navigating language barriers to ensure clear communication and foster meaningful connections. Through patience and creativity, I helped build students' confidence and academic skills, while supporting their personal growth in a supportive and nurturing environment.</p>
